https://github.com/ahadius/backendApiExam       //this is for the backend



do note this exam was before and i had more or less good ammount of code i prepeared last time (last exam, this one is basicly the same)
thats why i didnt have much of git push history inside github, i also got errors and set up issues wich i in response in desperation re created both  repo, i did find the issue and it was that i was using the old exam folder when i continued on it, that one unf didnt accept a new github repo.

courses ive taken and used for this exam:
